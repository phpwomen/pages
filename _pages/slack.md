<strong>tl;dr:</strong> Our conversations are mainly on slack, join us! <a href="https://phpwomen.signup.team">https://phpwomen.signup.team</a>
<h2>What is Slack?</h2>
In a nutshell Slack is an online chat service for teams. You can read more about the service here: <a href="https://slack.com">https://slack.com</a>
<h2>Why Slack?</h2>
After many years of IRC, PHPWomen has decided to move most of our communication onto Slack. Our old IRC channel #phpwomen is still on freenode. Slack is a popular tool that many of us are already used with at work. It is very user friendly and makes it much easier to have conversations, regardless of technical ability.
<h2>What topics you can expect</h2>
Anything from kittens, events, scholarships, diversity topics and technology. We are a friendly, safe environment for PHP lovers and users to hangout, regardless of gender and any other factors.

You can always reach out to us on <a href="https://phpwomen.signup.team">Slack</a> or <a href="mailto:hello@phpwomen.org">e-mail</a> and we will be happy to support you.
<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
This is an official PHPWomen chat channel. We expect all our members to respect each other. That is why we have decided to include a Code of Conduct.
<h2>Administrators</h2>
For this code of conduct, we refer to the administrators of this team:
