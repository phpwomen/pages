<span style="font-weight: 400;">Find us at events or usergroups world wide</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you come and say "Hi"</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a conference you would like to have phpwomen representatives attend, get in touch (link to contact page)!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Show events and explain phpug / link to phpug</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make this smart to distinguish events we support / events we are at and also donâ€™t display events that have already past. Event organisers can apply for getting their event on our page through a form, we can accept or deny (with reason).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Event page: twitter feed, event description, comment section, apply for scholarship button. </span>
