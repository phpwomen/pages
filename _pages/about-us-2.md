<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the name, we are not a group of only women and we do not focus just on women.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are an inclusive global network of people and elePHPants striving together to reduce barriers in the PHP development world. We provide a support network for everyone to improve themselves and get involved in the community.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">PHPWomen started out on October 8th 2006 as a call for the women of PHP to “stand up and be counted” by Ligaya Turmelle and Elizabeth Naramore. PHPWomen offers a way to connect with each other since the women in the PHP World tend to be few and scattered all over the world. They rarely see other women at the various events and groups. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013 Ligaya Turmelle and Elizabeth Naramore passed the presidency onto </span><a href="https://twitter.com/the_linie"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lineke Kerckhoffs-Willems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/michellesanver"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Sanver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2015 Kayla Daniels joined as US lead. The PHPWomen group also consists of several active members all helping to drive the group forward.</span>

<b>What about the men? Diversity is beauty</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as we wish it was not true, women are a minority in the majority of tech fields. We hope that by calling for women to be stood up and counted, we gain a greater insight to the amount of women in the industry and enable women in the same geographic location to meet up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we still believe that any group is better when it is diverse. This leads to any person no matter their background, race, religion or gender to feel included. It also leads to many different viewpoints which makes us stronger together. Our goal is that the PHP community members all feel included and that they are proud to say that they support our work, and each other. This also means that we treat all our members equally and we expect everyone to do the same. </span>
