<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that diversity is beauty. The sad truth is that many conferences have a smaller percentage of women attending than the working industry in those areas, of course there can be many reasons for this. </span>
<blockquote><strong>The key to increasing diversity is creating an inclusive environment. </strong>-<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.diversitymatters.it">Diversity Matters</a></blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to create an inclusive environment</span></h2>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a visible Code of Conduct, it matters that any minority see that they can feel safe and that there is a plan in case something would happen, and it shows that the conference is taking everything seriously. Also: Don’t just have a Code of Conduct, ensure that there’s a point of contact and mention it in the beginning of the event. Don’t be afraid to enforce the CoC and promise full confidentiality in any issues raised. If you want a good example we are big fans of the Open Source bridge code of conduct, in fact, we use it ourselves: <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/about/code-of-conduct/">http://opensourcebridge.org/about/code-of-conduct/</a></span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want an inclusive community you sometimes have to look outside of the “tech bubble”. Look at universities, friends of friends, colleagues, old classmates, grandma’s dart club - It all counts. Try to create an environment that is not the average “tech environment”. </span><a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2015/01/13/diversify-how-we-created-a-hackathon-with-50-50-female-male-participants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify did this in their diversify hackathon - And succeeded. </span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you offer anything during the registration process, which is often the first point of contact, such as a t-shirt: Ensure that there is a range of sizes such as 4XL and 2XS too. Also ensure that there is not just one fit.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To include people with food intolerances and allergies, ensure that you have dietary preferences in the registration form as a free text field: And adhere to them during the conference. This means that people with food preferences clearly know where and how to get their food, this often means that there are clear signs stating “Free of nuts” if someone has a nut allergy. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure that your venue and all rooms is accessible to people with various disabilities. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offer a quiet room where people can go for prayers or to unwind. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Host a family friendly event, this means having child care at your event for parents with children of all ages. Having wider seats near the exits in conference rooms, where parents can sit with their child helps a lot. Advertise that your conference is family friendly.</span></li>
</ul>
