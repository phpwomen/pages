If you are considering donating first and foremost: Thank you. You can make a general donation using PayPal with the button on the topÂ of this page.

You can also donate with a bank transfer using our US or EU bank accounts. Contact us for this option.
<h2>Scholarships</h2>
We love sending people to conferences who would otherwise not be able to attend.

This is where most of our funds go. You can also donate flights, hotel and conference tickets directly to members of PHPWomen with us as mediator.
<h2>Conference Speakers</h2>
Conferences often offer a speaker package. In an effort to keep ticket prices low: The speaker package is often not large enough for speakers on more remote places. In general we encourage local speakers but of course we would love to support speakers living in more remote places too. We do this by covering extra travel costs, and if needed, part of their hotel.
<h2>Promotion material</h2>
In order to spread the word we need promotion material, such as stickers, booth material and business cards.
<h2>Other Donations</h2>
Sometimes we want to realise other projects and ideas, we would love your financial support for those too! Contact us if you have an idea that would benefit our members.

<strong>Thank you.
