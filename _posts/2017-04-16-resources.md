<h2>Mentoring in PHP</h2>
We believe that mentoring helps all programmers of any level. Both being and having a mentor can have tremendous benefits in your learning - And after all, as programmers we never stop learning. PHP mentoring is a peer to peer mentoring organisation where you can get mentors to help you in your code adventures, and be a mentor to others. We support them and can recommend them to all of our members.
