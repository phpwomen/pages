The lovely team at PHP South Coast have given us a booth space which we would love to use.

We're looking for two people to help us staff the booth and sell elePHPants at <a href="http://2015.phpsouthcoast.co.uk">PHPSouthCoast</a> .

In return, you get a free ticket as a thanks!

If this is something you would be interested in, please get in touch with us.
