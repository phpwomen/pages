We have two $1000 dollar + ticket scholarships for LaraconUS but can't find any people, are you interested or know anyone interested in this opportunity?

<span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">All that you need is an interest and an eagerness to learn! </span></span>

Please let us know, we would love to help improve the dev world, one developer at a time <span class="_47e3 _5mfr" title="smile emoticon">!</span>
